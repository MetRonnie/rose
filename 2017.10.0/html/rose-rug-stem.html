              <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

              <p>This part of the Rose user guide explains how to
              use the <samp>rose stem</samp> testing system, and
              the motivation behind it.</p>

              <p><samp>rose stem</samp> requires the use of
              <a href="https://github.com/metomi/fcm">FCM</a> as it
              requires some of the version control information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

              <p>Why do we test code?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Motivation II</h3>

              <p>Most people would answer something along the lines
              of "so we know it works".</p>

              <p>However, this is really asking two related but
              separate questions.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Does the code do what I meant it to do?</li>

                <li>Does the code do anything I didn't mean it to
                do?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Motivation III</h3>

              <p>Answering the first question may involve writing a
              bespoke test and checking the results. The second
              question can at least partially be answered by using
              an automated testing system which runs predefined
              tasks and presents the answers. <samp>rose
              stem</samp> is a system for doing this.</p>

              <p><em>N.B. When writing tests for new code, they
              should be added to the testing system so that future
              developers can be confident that they haven't broken
              the new functionality.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="rose-stem">Rose Stem</h2>

              <p>There are two components in rose stem:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><samp>rose stem</samp> - the command line tool
                which executes an appropriate suite.</li>

                <li><samp>rose ana</samp> - a Rose task app which
                can compare the result of a task against a
                control.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We will describe each in turn. It is intended that
              a test suite lives alongside the code in the same
              version-controlled project, which should encourage
              developers to update the test suite when they update
              the code. This means that the test suite will always
              be a valid test of the code it is accompanying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="running-rose-stem">Running a suite with <samp>rose
              stem</samp></h2>

              <p>The <code>rose stem</code> command is essentially
              a wrapper to <code>rose suite-run</code>, which
              accepts some additional arguments and converts them
              to Jinja2 variables which the suite can
              interpret.</p>

              <p>These arguments are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><code>--source</code> - specifies a source tree
                to include in a suite.</li>

                <li><code>--group</code> - specifies a group of
                tasks to run.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>A <em>group</em> is a set of Rose tasks which
              together test a certain configuration of a
              program.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="the-source-argument">The <code>--source</code>
                argument</h2>

              <p>The source argument provides a set of Jinja2
              variables which can then be included in any
              compilation tasks in a suite. You can specify
              multiple <code>--source</code> arguments on the
              command line. For example:</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --source=/path/to/workingcopy --source=fcm:other_project_tr@head
</pre>

              <p>Each source tree is associated with a project (via an
              <samp>fcm</samp> command) when <code>rose stem</code> is run
              on the command line. This project name is then used in the
              construction of the Jinja2 variable names.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source II</h3>

              <p>Each project has a Jinja2 variable <code>SOURCE_FOO</code>
              where FOO is the project name. This contains a space-separated
              list of all sourcetrees belonging to that project, which can
              then be given to an appropriate build task in the suite so it
              builds those source trees.</p>
              
              <p>Similarly, a <code>HOST_SOURCE_FOO</code> variable is also
              provided. This is identical to <code>SOURCE_FOO</code> except
              any working copies have the local hostname prepended. This is
              to assist building on remote machines.</p>

              <p>The first source specified must be a working copy which
              contains the <samp>rose stem</samp> suite. The suite is
              expected to be in a subdirectory named <code>rose-stem</code>
              off the top of the working copy. This source is used to
              generate three additional variables:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><code>SOURCE_FOO_BASE</code> - the base directory of
                the project</li>

                <li><code>HOST_SOURCE_FOO_BASE</code> - the base directory
                of the project with the hostname prepended if it is a
                working copy</li>

                <li><code>SOURCE_FOO_REV</code> - the revision of the
                project (if any)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>These settings <b>override</b> the variables in the
              <code>rose-suite.conf</code> file.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source III</h3>

              <p>These should allow the use of configuration files which
              control the build process inside the working copy, e.g. you
              can refer to:</p>
              <pre>
      {{HOST_SOURCE_FOO_BASE}}/fcm-make/configs/machine.cfg{{SOURCE_FOO_REV}}
</pre>

              <p>If you omit the source argument, <samp>rose
              stem</samp> defaults to assuming</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --source=.
</pre>

              <p>viz. that the current directory is part of the
              working copy which should be added as a source
              tree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source IV</h3>

              <p>The project to which a source tree belongs is
              normally automatically determined using FCM commands.
              However, in the case where the source tree is not a
              valid FCM URL, or where you wish to assign it to
              another project, you can specify this using the
              <code>--source</code> argument:</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --source=foo=/path/to/source
</pre>

              <p>assigns the URL <code>/path/to/source</code> to
              the <samp>foo</samp> project, so the variables
              <samp>SOURCE_FOO</samp> and
              <samp>SOURCE_FOO_BASE</samp> will be set to
              <code>/path/to/source</code>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="the-group-argument">The <code>--group</code>
                argument</h2>

              <p>The group argument is used to provide a Pythonic
              list of groups in the variable <samp>RUN_NAMES</samp>
              which can then be looped over in a suite to switch
              sets of tasks on and off.</p>

              <p>Each <code>--group</code> argument adds another
              group to the list. For example:</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --group=mygroup --group=myothergroup
</pre>

              <p>runs two groups named <em>mygroup</em> and
              <em>myothergroup</em> with the current working copy.
              The suite will then interpret these into a set of
              tasks which build with the given source tree(s), run
              the program, and compare the output.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3>The <code>--task</code> argument</h3>

              <p>The <code>--task</code> argument is provided as a
              synonym for <code>--group</code>. Depending on how
              exactly the <samp>rose stem</samp> suite works users
              may find one of these arguments more intuitive to use
              than the other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="rose-ana">Comparing output with <samp>rose
              ana</samp></h2>

              <p>Any task beginning with <i>rose_ana_</i> will be
              interpreted by Rose as a <samp>rose ana</samp> task,
              and run through the <samp>rose ana</samp> task
              app.</p>

              <p>A <samp>rose ana</samp> <code>rose-app.conf</code>
              file contains a series of blocks; each one describing
              a different analysis task to perform. A common task
              which <samp>rose ana</samp> is used for is to compare
              output contained in different files (e.g. from a new test 
              versus previous output from a control). The analysis
              modules which provide these tasks are flexible and able
              to be provided by the user; however there is one built-in
              module inside <samp>rose ana</samp> itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana II</h3>

              <p>An example based on the built-in <code>grepper</code> module:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf" >
  [ana:grepper.FilePattern(Compare data from myfile)]
  pattern='data value:(\d+)'
  files=/data/kgo/myfile
       =../run.1/myfile
</pre>
              <p>This tells <samp>rose ana</samp> to scan the
              contents of the file <code>../run.1/myfile</code>
              (which is relative to the <samp>rose ana</samp>
              task's <code>work</code> directory) and the contents
              of <code>/data/kgo/myfile</code> for the specified regular
              expression. Since the pattern contains a group (in parentheses)
              so it is the contents of this group which will be compared 
              between the two files. The <code>grepper.FilePattern</code>
              analysis task can optionally be given a "tolerance" option for
              matching numeric values, but without it the matching is expected
              to be exact. If the pattern or group contents do not match the
              task will return a failure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana III</h3>
              <p>As well as sections defining analysis tasks, <samp>rose_ana</samp>
              apps allow for one additional section for storing global 
              configuration settings for the app. Just like the tasks themselves
              these options and their effects are dependent on which analysis 
              tasks are used by the app.</p>

              <p>Therefore we will here present an example using the built-in
              <code>grepper</code> class. An app may begin with a section like
              this:</p>

              <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf" >
  [ana:config]
  grepper-report-limit=5
  skip-if-all-files-missing=.true.
</pre>

            </div>
            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana IV</h3>

             <p>Each of these modifies the behaviour of <code>grepper</code>. 
             The first option suppresses printed output for each analysis task
             once the specified number of lines have been printed (in this case
             5 lines). The second option causes <samp>rose_ana</samp> to skip
             any <code>grepper</code> tasks which compare files in the case that
             <i>both</i> files do not exist.</p>

             <p>Note that any options given to this section may instead be 
             specified in the <code>rose-ana</code> section of the user or site 
             configuration. In the case that the same configuration option
             appears in both locations the one contained in the app file will
             take precedence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana V</h3>

              <p>It is possible to add additional analysis modules to 
              <samp>rose ana</samp> by placing an appropriately formatted
              python file in one of the following places (in order of 
              precedence):</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The <code>ana</code> sub-directory of the 
                  <code>rose ana</code> app</li>
                <li>The <code>ana</code> sub-directory of the
                  suite</li>
                <li>Any other directory which is accessible to the process
                  running <code>rose ana</code> and is specified in the
                  <code>method-path</code> variable in the
                  <code>rose ana</code> section of the
                  <code>rose.conf</code> file.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The only module provided with Rose can be found at
              <code>lib/python/rose/apps/ana_builtin/grepper.py</code> and it
              provides the following analysis tasks and options:</p>

              <p>The <code>grepper</code> analysis module also supports some

              section of the app or in the <code>[rose-ana]</code> section of

              <ul>
                <li><b>grepper-report-limit:</b> A numerical value giving the
                  maximum number of informational output lines to print for 
                  each comparison. This is intended for cases where for example
                  a pattern-matching comparison is expected to match many 
                  thousands of occurences in the given files; it may not be 
                  desirable to print the results of every comparison. After

                  indicating that the rest of the output is truncated will be

                  comparison done on files by <code>grepper</code> will be 
                  skipped if <i>all</i> of those files are non-existent. In 
                  this case the task will return as "skipped" rather than

              <p>The format for analysis modules themselves is relatively
              simple; the easiest route to understanding how they should be
              arranged is likely to look at the built-in <code>grepper</code>
              module. But the key concepts are as follows. To be recognised
              as a valid analysis module, the Python file must contain at least 
              one class which inherits and extends
              <code>rose.apps.rose_ana.AnalysisTask</code>, which will 
              automatically populate itself with certain attributes; e.g:</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
from rose.apps.rose_ana import AnalysisTask

class CustomAnalysisTask(AnalysisTask):
    """My new custom analysis task."""
    def run_analysis(self):
        print self.options  # Dictionary of options (see next slide)
        if self.options["option1"] == "5":
            self.passed = True
</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana XII</h3>
              <p>Assuming the above was saved in a file called 
              <code>custom.py</code> and placed into a folder suitable for
              analysis modules this would allow a <code>rose ana</code> app
              to specify:</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[ana:custom.CustomAnalysisTask(Example rose-ana test)]
option1 = 5
option2 = test of rose ana
option3 = .true.
</pre>
              <p>Note that the <code>custom</code> part of the filename appears
              at the start of the <code>ana</code> entry, followed by the name
              of the desired class (in the style of Python's own namespacing). 
              All options specified by the app-task will be processed by 
              <code>rose ana</code> into a dictionary and attached to the 
              running analysis class instance as the <code>options</code> 
              attribute.  Hopefully you can see that in this case the task would
              <i>pass</i> because <code>option1</code> is set to <code>5</code>
              as required by the class.</p>

              <p>The parent <code>AnalysisTask</code> class will also set 
              several other attributes which may be of use when designing a 
              new method:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>self.config</b> - a dictionary containing any

                <li><b>self.reporter</b> - a reference to the 
                <code>rose.reporter.Reporter</code> instance used by the parent 
                app (for printing to stderr/stdout)</li>
                <li><b>self.kgo_db</b> - a reference to the KGO database 
                object created by the parent app (for adding entries to the
                database - see next section)</li>
                <li><b>self.popen</b> - a reference to the 
                <code>rose.popen.RosePopener</code> instance used by the parent
                app (for spawning subprocesses)</li>

              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana XIV</h3>

              <p>The parent class also provides the <b>self.passed</b> and 
              <b>self.skipped</b> methods, which will default to 
              <code>False</code> but should be set to <code>True</code> by the 
              task to indicate how <samp>rose ana</samp> should proceed.  (Note 
              that the <b>skipped</b> state is only checked if the <b>passed</b>
