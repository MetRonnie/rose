            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

              <p>This part of the Rose user guide walks you through
              using the <a href=
              "rose-rug-task-run.html#rose-task-run.util.rose_bunch">
              Rose Bunch</a> built in app.</p>

              <p>This allows multiple variants of a command to be
              run under a single job.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

              <p>Often, we want to run many instances of a command
              that differ only slightly from each other at the same
              time - an example would be where a command is run
              repeatedly with only its arguments changing.</p>

              <p>Rather than creating multiple apps or optional
              configs to change the way a command is to be run, we
              can instead use the built-in <var>rose bunch</var>
              application to run multiple command variants, in
              parallel, under a single job as defined by an
              application configuration.</p>

              <p>Note, however, that for "embarassingly parallel"
              code it would be better to alter the code rather than
              use rose bunch to handle this for you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>

              <p>It is important to note that when running your
              <var>rose bunch</var> app under load balancing
              systems such as PBS or Slurm, you will need to set
              resource requests to reflect the resources required
              by running multiple commands at once.</p>

              <p>For example, if a single command would require 1GB
              memory and the app is configured to run up to 4
              commands at once then 4GB of memory should be
              requested.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="example-task">Example</h2>

              <p>In this example we are going to create a suite
              that simulates the handling of landing planes at an
              airport. For a given plane the process of landing and
              unloading is the same: land, taxi to the terminal,
              unload passengers and get clear. We can refer to this
              as the "landing" routine. What differs between
              landings is the plane type, number of passengers
              carried and the resulting timings for each stage of
              the landing process.</p>

              <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour.html#cli">new
              suite</a> (or just a new directory somewhere - e.g.
              in your homespace) containing a blank
              <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> and a
              <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks like this:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example suite.rc</h3>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[cylc]
    UTC mode = True # Ignore DST
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = lander
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        script = rose task-run
    [[lander]]
</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App</h3>

              <p>In the suite directory create an <samp>app/</samp>
              directory</p>
              <pre class="shell">
mkdir app
</pre>

              <p>In the <var>app</var> directory create a
              <var>lander/</var> directory</p>
              <pre class="shell">
cd app
mkdir lander
</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App (2)</h3>

              <p>In the <var>app/lander/</var> directory create a
              <samp>rose-app.conf</samp> file using your editor of
              choice and paste the following lines into it:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
mode=rose_bunch

[bunch]
command-format=land %(class)s %(passengers)s

[bunch-args]
class=airbus concorde airbus cessna
passengers=40 20 30 2
</pre>

              <p>This configuration will run a <code>rose
              bunch</code> task that calls multiple instances of
              the <code>land</code> command, supplying arguments to
              each instance from the <var>class</var> and
              <var>passengers</var> entries under
              <var>[bunch-args]</var>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App (3)</h3>

              <p>In the <var>app/lander/</var> directory create a
              <samp>bin/</samp> directory:</p>
              <pre class="shell">
mkdir bin
</pre>

              <p>Using your editor of choice, create a file named
              "land" under the bin directory and paste in <a href=
              "etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-rose-bunch/src/land.html">
              these</a> lines. This script capures the landing
              routine and expects two arguments; the plane type
              (its class) and the number of passengers it is
              carrying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App (4)</h3>

              <p>Finally, make the new <samp>land</samp> file
              executable by navigating into the bin directory of
              the <samp>lander</samp> app and running:</p>
              <pre class="shell">
chmod +x land
</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Run Example</h3>

              <p>Navigate to the top directory of your suite (where
              the <samp>suite.rc</samp> and
              <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> files can be found) and
              run <samp>rose suite-run</samp>. Your suite should
              run, launch the cylc gui and successfully run the
              lander app.</p>

              <p>Once the suite has finished running and has
              shutdown, open <samp>rose bush</samp> to view its
              output (note that you can close the cylc gui at this
              point). You can quickly get to the relevent page by
              running <samp>rose slv</samp> from within the suite
              directory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Examine output</h3>

              <p>In the <samp>rose bush</samp> jobs page for your
              suite you should be presented with a page containing a
              single row for the <samp>lander</samp> task, from which
              you can access its output. In that row you should see
              something like this:</p><img src=
              "img/rose-bunch-rose-bush-view.png" alt=
              "rose bush view of output"
              class="img-full centre-slide"/>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Examine output (2)</h3>

              <p>In the <samp>rose bush</samp> entry you should see
              that the usual links are present for the task such as
              for <var>job.out</var>, <var>job.status</var> etc.
              with the addition of two drop down boxes: one for
              <var>bunch.*.err</var> and one for
              <var>bunch.*.out</var>. Rather than mixing the
              outputs from the multiple command invocations being
              run at once, <samp>rose bunch</samp> directs their
              output to individual output files. So, for example,
              the ouput from running the command with the first set
              of parameters can be found in the
              <var>bunch.0.out</var> file, the second set in the
              <var>bunch.1.out</var> file etc. Examine these output
              files now to confirm that all four of the args
              combinations have been run and produced output.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="naming-invocations">Naming invocations</h2>

              <p>While the different invocations of the command
              have their own output directed to indexed files, it
              can sometimes be difficult to quickly identify which
              file to look in for output. To aid this, <code>rose
              bunch</code> supports naming command instances via
              the <code>[bunch]names=</code> option.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Naming invocations (2)</h3>

              <p>Open your app config (under
              <var>app/lander/rose-app.conf</var>) and add the
              following line under the <code>[bunch]</code>
              section:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
names=BA123 Emirates345 BA007 PC456
</pre>

              <p>Re-run your suite and, once it has finished, open
              up <var>rose bush</var> and examine the job listing.
              In the drop-down <var>bunch.*.err</var> and
              <var>bunch.*.out</var> boxes you should now see
              entries for the names you've configured rather than
              the <var>bunch.0.out ... bunch.3.out</var> entries
              previously present.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="limits">Limiting concurrent invocations</h2>

              <p>In some situations we may need to limit the number
              of concurrently running command invocations - often
              as a result of resource limitations. Rather than
              batching up jobs into sets of <var>N</var>
              simultaneously running commands, <code>rose
              bunch</code> apps can be configured to run as many
              commands as possible within some limit i.e. while
              <var>N</var> commands are running, if one of them
              finishes, don't wait for the remaining <var>N-1</var>
              jobs to finish before running the <var>N+1</var>th
              one.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Limiting concurrent
              invocations (2)</h3>

              <p>In the case of our simulated airport we will
              pretend we only have two runways available at a time
              on which our planes can land. As such we need to
              limit the number of planes being landed. We do this
              using the <code>[bunch]pool-size=</code>
              configuration option of the <code>rose bunch</code>
              app.</p>

              <p>Open your app config (under
              <var>app/lander/rose-app.conf</var>) and add the
              following line to the <code>[bunch]</code>
              section:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
pool-size=2
</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Limiting concurrent
              invocations (3)</h3>

              <p>Run your suite again. Notice that this time round
              it takes longer for the task to run as it has been
              limited in the number of command variants it can run
              simultaneously. You can see the individual commands
              being started by viewing the task stdout in the cylc
              gui by right clicking on the task and selecting
              "View" then "job stdout". As an example, when the
              "BA007" invocation starts running you should see the
              line:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[INFO] BA007: added to pool
</pre>

              <p>appear in the job output after a while whereas,
              when running without a pool-size, the line will
              appear pretty quickly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

              <p>In this tutorial we have learnt how to configure a
              <var>rose bunch</var> app to run a set of command
              variants under one job. We have learnt how to name
              the individual variants for convenience in examining
              the logs and how to limit the number of concurrently
              running commands.</p>

              <p>Further options are listed in the <code>rose
